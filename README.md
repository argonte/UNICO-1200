# UNICO-1200
New firmware of spectrophotometer UNICO-1200

This project is aimed at developing the program code of the STM32F103 microcontroller to replace the standard one installed in spectrophotometers. This will allow to expand their functionality and increase the accuracy of measurements.
I will be glad if it is useful to someone. I created this project for myself because the firmware of the standard microcontroller was corrupted.
